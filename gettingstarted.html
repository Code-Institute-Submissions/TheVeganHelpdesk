                                All good things take time! <br>
                                And all things health related should be done slowly. IF you go straight from three meals of meat and cheese a day to full on plant based, your body will not thank you! My advice is to designate 2 days a week to eating no animal products to start. Then, start <em>reducing</em> the amount of meat you eat the other 5 days. When you’re comfortable, try 4 vegan days, etc…<br>
                                You are going to miss the texture of meat. This is where all those wonderful meat substitutes you’ve been seeing everywhere, come in handy. It’s not quite the same, but it’s a start as you adjust. See below for more on these.<br>
                                As you phase out the animal products, slowly phase in the beans, lentils, extra fruit and veg etc… Again, slowly. A lot of plant based foods are naturally high in fibre and if this is not your norm, you’re gonna want to pace that particular adjustment!

                                There is a huge range of vegan “meat” options to stop you feeling like you’re missing out. This year alone, supermarkets really stepped up to make sure they had good ‘own brand’ options. And there are all types to choose from!<br>
                                Following in the footsteps of the eternally popular Linda McCartney and Quorn brands, many brands and supermarkets have stepped up and brought out their own textured protein meat replacement options. There appears to be a personal preference element to choosing which one would like. Some have a decidedly more “meaty” texture than others and are very good for starting out. Do also check out your local health food store though, as they will likely supply brands that take more care to used recycled products in their packaging, or even plant based packaging itself, which is compostable!<br>
                                Another main option for vegan burgers are the bean/vegetable based patties. Very often, these have much less unreadable ingredients and companies have taken more care in recent years to supply an amazing range of flavours and bases for these burgers. And they tend to be much more reasonably priced too. Even compared to meat!

                                “But how do you get protein?” - everyone, ever<br>
                                Wrapping your head around new kinds of protein will soon become second nature. Beans, lentils, nuts seeds, tofu, and tempeh, to name but a few will be easy reliable sources of protein, and very versatile, so you don’t miss out on flavour. Most meat substitutes are protein based too. In the western world, it’s generally regarded that we eat too much protein as it is. But with even a little mindfulness regarding your protein intake, you shouldn’t have any problems at all.<br>
                                Vitamin B12 is where it can get a little trickier. Look for foods fortified with this vitamin  when you can, as it is generally only found naturally in decidedly un-plant-based foods! And it is a very essential vitamin. Again with some mindfulness regarding sourcing B12, you should be ok. Arm yourself with the signs of a deficiency though, as this is one that’s best tackled early.

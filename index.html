                    We are a merry band of chill vegans - both full and part
                    time - looking to spread the good word ONLY to those who
                    want to hear it! As with anything, this is a lifestyle that
                    should be a choice, and we would like to make that as
                    accessible to as many people as we possibly can. We believe
                    that how you go about attempting plant based foods is your
                    own choice. There's a lot of info out there that can make
                    the transition seem daunting and it absolutely doesn't have
                    to be! So! Let's begin!

                    Have you been toying with the idea of going plant based
                    since seeing all the delicious instagram posts last
                    Veganuary?<br />Are you aware of how your food habits impact
                    the environment and want to change?<br />Do you feel overly
                    reliant on meat and want to include other options into your
                    diet?<br />Are you unsure whether going "full vegan" is for
                    you, but don't know the best way to find out?<br />Did you
                    adopt a pet pig and are now battling feelings of guilt and

                    Fortunately, it has never been easier to be vegan in
                    Ireland. With the popularity of Veganuary, supermarkets are
                    taking notice of the "trend" and are working to provide more
                    and more plant-based options. While sure, these count more
                    as "fast food" sometimes, it's real good to have the options
                    of treats! It's not all just meat replacements though.
                    Theres a whole world of natural foods out there that contain
                    the proteins and vitamins you need to make the transition
                    safely and deliciously!<br />
                    But why has become so popular?<br />Scroll down to see some
                    of the many reasons people are happily adopting a more
                    plant-based lifestyle.

                As the climate crisis the world is facing grows ever more
                extreme, people are looking for ways they can contribute to the
                reversal of the damage. Countless studies have shown that food
                accounts for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, some 70% of fresh
                water usage, and agricultural means account for around 50% of
                habitable land on earth. Of this, meat dairy and fish are
                consistently the worst offenders. And by a large percentage. In
                almost every category - land usage, water usage, emissions,
                pollutants - plant-based proteins/kilogram contribute a tiny
                fraction to the problem, compared to the same weight of meat
                protein. If you are a heavy meant eater, going plant based just
                two days a week could reduce your carbon footprint by up to
                30%!!! I mean, if that’s not a good enough reason, keep reading…

                Let’s be honest, this is a no brainer! We all know the idea
                behind this one, even if we try not to think about it. Where
                it’s managed sustainably and ethically, farming is
                farming-well-done. Humans have always eaten meat. It’s just
                lately, we’ve managed to industrialise the breeding, growing and
                slaughtering of animals to the point where it’s beyond inhumane.
                This meets a crazy demand for meat, a lot of which goes to
                waste, and we justify it because it’s cheaper. None of this
                makes sense, and yet, tis true!<br />
                We could not imagine treating our beloved pets as disposable, so
                who says it’s ok to do this to animals, and why?! Why do this
                luffy sheep, dancing goats, friendly cows or cute little
                chicks.<br />
                It’s within our power to reduce the demand on cheap meat. Buy
                free range and organically farmed if you’re not going full time
                vegan, and take the time to appreciate the animal that was. Buy
                only what you need. This needn’t apply only to meat by the by!

                Fruit and veg and all the vitamins you can think of! Obviously
                these are not foods specific to a vegan diet, but you do find
                yourself eating more of them when cheesy treats and milk
                chocolate are taken out of the mix. Done well, n diet will also
                be much less carcinogenic that your average smoked lunch
                meat.<br /><br />
                Done well is the operative term here. We will look later on at
                making sure you don’t miss out on vital nutrients, but chances
                are you will be getting more than you do now from the get go.
                Ongoing studies into the benefits of following a t based diet,
                even just for a few days a week, show reductions in heart
                disease and cholesterol, better blood sugar levels idney
                functions and less risk of inflammatory issues such as
                arthritis.*<br /><br />
                Vegan protein is easy to come by and most options are extremely
                versatile additions to your favourite dishes.<br /><br />

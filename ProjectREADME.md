# The Vegan Helpdesk
## User Centric Frontend Project - Code Institute
---
A community based website for new and old vegans, people who are interestd in starting a vegan lifestyle/diet, or those who wish to try it out once or twice a week for any reasons whatsoever. Features will include
- reasons to try out a plant based diet
- advice on getting started and what to try/where to look/who to follow on social media
- a featured brand specialising in plant based foods
- a sign-up to receive monthly e-zines on new products on the market, community recipes, and the featured brands

---
## Goals
---
This is a platform for people who wish to try more plant based eating, but feel overwhelmed/confused by the info that's out there. The main pages will feature solid, simple reasons and tips to make the move to plant based eating, while the featured brand and e-zine will have more comprehensive tips and ideas.

The end goal will be to build the community and attract brands to purchase space in the e-zine. Therefore, the website will need to highlight how easily achievable going plant based is.

The target customers are:
- people looking to go full- or part-time vegan
- people who are already trying and looking for tips/motivation


## UX

This site is aimed at
- English speakers
- Lives in Ireland (not necessarily, but the aim would be to have local small plant based businesses get feature spots)
- Is preferrably over 18 and can make the choice themself

People who come here are looking for guidance on introducing veganism into their lifestyle

The Helpdesk will be a good place to go because:
- veganism is often seen as extreme or preachy, we will not be
- this will be an inclusive and easy going approach
- there are no requirements in terms of commitments, this is just a guide for the visitor
- the information will be short, sweet and relaxed
- There will be an option to sign up to receive favourite recipe and product ideas for free!


## The Site - Features

Each page has a responsive navigation bar at the top, which collapses down to a hamburger button and the site name on smaller devices. The footer matches in colour with basic "copyright" info and social links (These lead to the various social media main pages as this company is fictional!).

There is an over-all colour scheme of cream, green and charcoal, with the green being taken from the main hero image. The local hero page has a different layout and aesthetic, as its focus is to promote a parter company. The hero image becomes the background image to the sign up form.

### 1. Home page

This is an introductory page with a background style hero image intended not to clutter the header area. There is a small 'introductory' sentence to the left of the image. The title of the website will appear only in the browser and nav bars. The page conatins typical reasons peeple have for switching to a plant-based diet.

The first is environmental with a visual comparison of the various dietary impacts on the environment. This is purely a visual comparison aid using bootstraps progress bar tool. 

The second and third are animals and health, with accompanying images. All three observe the rule of thirds when viewed in full screen, and condense as the screen gets smaller to a mobile screen where elements take a full col-12 width.

*there was to be an introduction to the website above the reasons section here, but it ended up looking cluttered and a little childish, and ultimately added nothing to the website. There is a small about section added to______!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### 2. Getting Started Page

This completely follows the home page stylistically. 

### 3. Local Hero Page

This is a showcase of a local company that is plant-based or environmentally friendly. Apart from the header and footer, this page takes on the style of the featured company and links seperately to their website/social after a brief synopsis. There will also be a link here to our sign up (modal version) as they will also receive 15% off our monthly featured heros products when purchased online.

### 4. Sign Up Page

This features the hero image as a full background for the page. The sign up form contains options for what type of diet the user wishes to follow.

# The Vegan Helpdesk
## User Centric Frontend Project - Code Institute
---
A community based website for new and old vegans, people who are interestd in starting a vegan lifestyle/diet, or those who wish to try it out once or twice a week for any reasons whatsoever. Features will include
- reasons to try out a plant based diet
- advice on getting started and what to try/where to look/who to follow on social media
- a featured brand specialising in plant based foods
- a sign-up to receive monthly e-zines on new products on the market, community recipes, and the featured brands

## Goals
---
This is a platform for people who wish to try more plant based eating, but feel overwhelmed/confused by the info that's out there. The main pages will feature solid, simple reasons and tips to make the move to plant based eating, while the featured brand and e-zine will have more comprehensive tips and ideas.

The end goal will be to build the community and attract brands to purchase space in the e-zine. Therefore, the website will need to highlight how easily achievable going plant based is.

The target customers are:
- people looking to go full- or part-time vegan
- people who are already trying and looking for tips/motivation


# UX

This site is aimed at
- English speakers
- Lives in Ireland (not necessarily, but the aim would be to have local small plant based businesses get feature spots)
- Is preferrably over 18 and can make the choice themself

People who come here are looking for guidance on introducing veganism into their lifestyle

The Helpdesk will be a good place to go because:
- veganism is often seen as extreme or preachy, we will not be
- this will be an inclusive and easy going approach
- there are no requirements in terms of commitments, this is just a guide for the visitor
- the information will be short, sweet and relaxed
